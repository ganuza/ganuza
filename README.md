### Hi, thanks for taking the time to read about me. I'm a Colorado resident with a background in Science and over 20 years experience in the Wine Industry. Currently, I am transitioning to Software Development and Design in order to tackle a new challenge that will give me new skills for a bright future in an industry that is quickly and constantly evolving. I have found that continuous learning, hard work, perseverance, and grit have served me well and allowed me to continue to grow throughout my life, and I am hopeful that these values and new Web Development skills will serve to provide a long and successful career where I can help teams and companies create amazing applications that solve the needs of customers and users.
